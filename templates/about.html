        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I’m the creative mind behind Domingo Developments. As a self-proclaimed coding entrepreneur, I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our lives. My journey into web development started with a simple curiosity about how websites are built and a strong desire to help businesses shine online. Over time, what began as a hobby turned into my passion and career.</p>

        <p>What I love most about coding is the blend of art and logic it offers. I believe every website should not only be visually appealing but also user-friendly and functional. My goal is to understand your unique vision and transform it into a digital reality. I’m dedicated to crafting custom websites that resonate with your audience and elevate your brand.</p>

        <p>At Domingo Developments, I’m committed to staying on top of the latest trends and technologies to ensure that my clients get the best service possible. Whether you’re a budding entrepreneur or an established business, I’m excited to work with you and help you navigate the digital landscape. Let’s collaborate and create something amazing together!</p>
